    <h2><b> Description</b></h2>
    <p>
       Ndole is widely recognized as one of the national dishes of Cameroon. It is a rich stew of bitter leaves (or a substitute like spinach) cooked in a sauce made from ground peanuts (or peanut butter), onions, garlic, and then enriched with meat, smoked fish or shrimp.

    <p>
        <p>
            The unique taste emerges from the blend of the earthy bitterness of the leaves balanced by creamy peanut sauce and smoky seafood or meat, often served with plantains, cassava, rice or miondo.
        </p>
        This soup is traditionally served with a starchy accompaniment — most notably water fufu (fermented cassava dough) or garri — which helps capture its deep, forest‑like flavour and smooth texture.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul> 
        <li>~500 g bitter leaves (or frozen/ fresh leaves) or substitute spinach.</li>
        <li>~300‑500 g meat (beef, cow skin, tripe) or smoked fish; optionally shrimp.</li>
        <li>~200‑300 g raw peanuts, roasted then ground into paste.</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped.</li>
        <li>2‑3 cloves garlic, minced.</li>
        <li>2‑3 tablespoons palm oil (or vegetable oil).</li>
        <li>½‑1 cup ground crayfish (optional).</li>
        <li>Stock or water, salt, pepper, seasoning cube to taste.</li>
     
    </ul>

    <h2>Step‑by‑Step Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
       <li> Wash the bitter leaves thoroughly, then blanch in boiling water (with a little bicarbonate or kanwa if desired) multiple times until bitterness is reduced; chop finely. </li>

<li>Cook the meat (or fish) with salt and seasoning until tender; set aside and reserve the cooking stock.</li>

<li>Roast/blanch the peanuts, grind into a smooth paste; set aside.</li>
<li> In a pot, heat the palm oil; sauté the onion and garlic until translucent. Add the peanut paste and stir for a few minutes. </li>

<li> Add the chopped bitter leaves, then pour in reserved stock and/or water; mix and bring to simmer. Add the meat/fish, optionally ground crayfish, salt, pepper and seasoning cube.Add the eru/okazi leaves: Stir in the shredded eru/okazi leaves. Immediately add the palm oil, mixing thoroughly so the oil coats the greens before the colour fades. This helps maintain the vibrant green‑ish hue of the soup. </li>

<li> Simmer gently for 20‑30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until flavours combine and consistency is thick</li>

<li> SServe hot with boiled plantains, rice, bobolo, miondo or cassava sticks. </li>
