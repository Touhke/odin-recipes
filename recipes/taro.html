    <h2><b>Description</b></h2>
    <p>
        This dish, often called “Achu” or “Taro in Yellow Sauce,” originates from the Grassfields region (North‑West / West Cameroon). The starchy tuber (taro) is cooked, peeled and pounded into a smooth paste (“taro pilé”), then served with a rich yellow sauce made from palm oil, a special blend of traditional spices and sometimes meat or tripe.

    </p>
    <p>
        The yellow sauce’s distinctive colour comes from palm oil emulsified with water and “sel gemme” (canwa, a kind of alkaline rock) plus local spice blends; the dish is deeply symbolic and frequently featured at major ceremonies and celebrations.

    </p>

    <h2><b>Ingredients</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>~2 kg taro (whole tubers)</li>
        <li>~1 kg beef tripe or beef with skin or choice of meat.</li>
        <li>~190 g palm oil (or ~¼ cup depending on scale)</li>
        <li>~10‑16 g sel gemme (canwa)</li>
        <li>~1 sachet or mix of “épices sauce jaune” (traditional spice blend)</li>
        <li>1 L warm water (approx) for sauce dilution</li>
        <li>4 seasoning cubes (e.g., Maggi)</li>
        <li>1 chilli pepper (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><b>Steps</b></h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Wash the taro tubers and cook them “en robe des champs” (in their skins) in a large pot of water for around 2 hours, or until fully tender.</li>
        <li>While taro cooks, prepare the meat/tripe: wash, chop and boil with salt, seasoning cubes and any aromatics until tender; reserve the broth.</li>
        <li>Once taro is cooked, peel the skins while still hot and pound (or mash) them into a smooth paste, ensuring no lumps, adjusting moisture if needed.</li>
        <li>To prepare the yellow sauce: lightly heat the palm oil to liquify it; in a bowl dissolve the sel gemme in warm water, then gradually whisk/pour water into the oil to form an emulsion that turns pale yellow.</li>
        <li>Add the spice blend (“épices sauce jaune”), seasoning cubes, chilli (if using) and some of the meat/tripe broth to the sauce mixture; stir gently to combine.</li>
        <li>Incorporate the cooked meat/tripe into the sauce and adjust seasoning (salt, pepper) as needed; simmer briefly to warm through.</li>
        <li>To serve: shape the taro paste into a mound on a plate, then pour the yellow sauce with meat/tripe around or on top; the dish is traditionally eaten with fingers.</li>

    </ol>
