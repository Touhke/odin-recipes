    <h2><b> Description </b></h2>
    <p>
        Koki is a cherished traditional dish from Cameroon made primarily from black‑eyed peas (or cowpeas), which are soaked, peeled, ground into a paste, then enriched with palm oil and seasonings, wrapped in banana leaves (or foil) and steamed until firm. 
        It is often prepared for family gatherings and festive occasions, representing culinary ingenuity in using locally available legumes, palm oil, and leaves for cooking.
